4/4/23 10:24,"Cookie A (if cookies came stacked, top cookie)","Cookie D (if cookies came stacked, bottom cookie)",Cookie A,18 and up,Yes,"For A v. B, I like the flavor of B better but the texture of A more. Texture wins for me since I like softer cookies. I like the chips better in B. 

Same for C v. D on texture v flavor. C has better texture, D has better flavor. In this case flavor won out. ",R1

4/4/23 14:05,"Cookie A (if cookies came stacked, top cookie)","Cookie D (if cookies came stacked, bottom cookie)",Cookie A,18 and up,Yes,There should be a graph that shows the relationship to cookie liking and freshness.,R10
4/4/23 14:21,"Cookie B (if cookies came stacked, second from top cookie)","Cookie D (if cookies came stacked, bottom cookie)",Cookie B,18 and up,Yes,"Okay so these answers are soft-cookie bias corrected (i.e. my opinions after I microwaved the cookies so they all became softer) because I will always prefer a soft center cookie over a crunchy center cookie. My first impressions though were slightly different and they're here in case you want to use those answers instead: 
 - Cookie A over Cookie B 
 - Cooke D over Cookie C 
 - Cookie A best overall 

Other opinions: I love the salt and the chocolate chips of Cookie B. Does Cookie C have more vanilla in it? I was picking up more of a subtle vanilla flav (or at least I thought) in Cookie C that wasn't as strong in Cookie D (even though I liked Cookie D better overall). Also can I guess that the NYT one is Cookie B/D? ",R11

I also prefer its texture which felt slightly more chewy for me. I chose B over A because I really cherish the addition of salt to B and the big chocolate chunks were a (surprisingly) big hit for me. I was fully expecting to pick C over D given the lack of chunks, but in the end the thinness of C and the saltiness of D was big enough for me to pick D over C as well! GO SALT and go J-E-T-S",R30

The dough/texture was better in A but the chocolate chunks in B were better. I think I care most about the texture so I chose A over B. I would love the chocolate chunks of B in A. Cookie C also slapped. Thank you so much for these cookies.,R42
